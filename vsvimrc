" Like Vim, VsVim uses an rc file for its settings. VsVim will check the
" following candidate rc folders:
" 
"     %HOME%
"     %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%
"     %VIM%
"     %USERPROFILE%
" 
" Once it finds a folder, it will check for the following candidate rc files:
" 
"     .vsvimrc
"     _vsvimrc
"     .vimrc
"     _vimrc
" 
" You can use the set command (with no arguments) interactively to see what file
" VsVim found and loaded.
